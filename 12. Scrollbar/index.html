            Livewire 4 introduces view-based components as the default approach, allowing developers to co-locate PHP logic, Blade templates, and JavaScript in a single file instead of splitting them across multiple directories. Components are created with `php artisan make:livewire` and live in `resources/views/components`. JavaScript can be embedded using script tags, which Livewire extracts and serves as cacheable assets. The framework optionally uses emoji prefixes (⚡) to visually distinguish Livewire  components from regular Blade components. For larger components, developers can convert to multi-file layouts using `livewire:convert`, which creates a directory with separate PHP, Blade, and JS files while maintaining co-location. Livewire 4 remains fully backwards compatible with class-based components from version 3, and all defaults are configurable through the published config file   Livewire 4 introduces view-based components as the default approach, allowing developers to co-locate PHP logic, Blade templates, and JavaScript in a single file instead of splitting them across multiple directories.
